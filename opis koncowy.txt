Things not covered in the video:
Class dependency: 
card has a Suit and a Mark. cards have a list card objects (all in model directory)
Suit has a factory for its constructor- to iterate all Suits
in Bridge you have hand - hand consists of list of card objects;

to get first bid for a hand You need to have an apropriate class in Factory directory:
for convencion "Strong Pass" it is "StrongPassFirstBidclass" adding the apropriate name to the Conventions enum
